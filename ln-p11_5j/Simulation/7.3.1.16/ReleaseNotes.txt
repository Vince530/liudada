
Note 
    ParmterParser will no longer be included in Chromatix installer package, please use one from target build 
    to generating bin file
  
  Tuning ANR/TF: 
    For video and MFNR tuning (multiple frames), suggest to do in 2 steps for tuning, 
      1. Generate YUV file form IFE or BPS (from simulation tab), and copy to separate folder.
      2. Add sequence number at end of file (e.g. xyz_0.yuv, xyz_1.yuv ...)
      3. Tune ANR and TF using YUV files.

      MFNR, 
        1. make sure "MF" from "SW Control" is enabled
        2. make sure both number of MCC and flat files are equal or more than the number of frames defined in MF
        3. save TFblend output for postfiltering tuning
    
      Video
        Number of frames for simulation is defined under Simulation Tab
    Number of frames used to tune TF is defined in the module UI (can be modified)


Note on Scenario Modes:

    Scenario Modes are now configured using the ParameterTuningTypes.xsd file. 

    The default copy of ParameterTuningTypes.xsd can be found in the Chromatix install folder.  When creating a new,
    or opening an existing, project, if it does not already contain ParameterTuningTypes.xsd, the default version 
    will be copied to the project folder, and used from there.

    To modify the Scenario Modes, edit the version of ParameterTuningTypes.xsd in your project folder.  Please 
    follow the instructions in the ParameterTuningTypes.xsd file.
        
    When changing the Scenario Modes, do not edit any Modes that are already used in your project, or your project 
    will no longer load correctly.  It is best edit the Scenario Modes before adding any modes beyond the Default 
    and Sensor.  After editing the Scenario Modes, you must re-load the project in Chromatix before adding new Scenarios 
    using the Scenario Editor.

    Special case modes/sub modes:
    The following modes/sub modes are treated specially by Chromatix and changing or removing them may cause Chromatix
    to function improperly:
    1) Default mode
    2) Sensor mode
    3) Usecase mode
    4) Usecase sub modes: Preview, Snapshot, and Video.
    5) MFNRBlend and MFNRPostProc sub modes (do not rename, must be deleted together).

    All other modes and sub modes may be changed.
    Note: You may remove both MFNRBlend and MFNRPostProc sub modes together, but do not rename them, or remove one without 
    removing the other.

    Please use care when modifying ParameterTuningTypes.xsd file, as proper functionality of Chromatix is dependent upon
    a correctly configured Scenario Mode configuration file.


    Tips & Tricks:
    ------------
    1.If you face issue starting Chromatix, please install below :
      Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64) - 14.0.24215, 
            https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840
      Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Setup, 
            http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225704
            http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225702
                        
    2.Each run of Simulation creates a separate folder. This may take a lot of space on your hard disk. 
      Go To "Edit->Clean Simulation Data" to delta simulation files.
      
    3.Please make sure your default project folder path and input image path as short as possible, otherwise
      your simulation may fail due to windows max path size limitation, suggest to make the project folder under root.

    4.File Path and Name should not contain spaces.      
    
    5.For machine with limited memory, it may get slower after tuning some modules, or fail to open image at 
      end of simulation (popup a white window), you can delete images from image panel to improve performance.
      
    6.Default mode tuning:
       IFE, simulate in video mode
       BPS, simulate in snapshot mode
       IPE, simulate in snapshot mode
    
    8.You can uncheck "MF" to disable MFNR mode from "SW Control" when tuning none Noise/Sharpness related modules 
      to improve performance, however those modules are suggested to be tuned on parent (snapshot).

     Usage:
       * Capture jpg file from target with 3A debug and metadata
       * Open project (for generating bin file on target)
       * switch to "JPG Simulation" tab
       * click on "Open" button to load image

       * switch to "Simulation" tab (to run AWB simulation)
       * Add AWB DLL, .bin file, and JPG image
       * check "AWB simulation only"
       * Added a dummy image, and click on "Run Simulation",  watch the status window, now we have new CCT and WB gains generated
     
       * switch back to "JPG simulation"
       * click on simulate
           note, after simulation, the JPG and project config file text boxes will be filled with link to a file. if you simulate 
           again, you can check on "use file" to skip regenerate these files for saving time. AWB gains is reading from tuned 
           pipeline (WB module in IFE or BPS)

      Redo AWB simulation:
       * switch to "Simulation" tab and run AWB simulation 
       * switch back to "JPG simulation"
       * check "Use file" for JPG config since it is same we don’t need to regenerate it to save time
       * make sure "Use file" for Project config is uncheck, we need to generate new one due to AWB simulation update (CCT and WB gains).
       * click on "simulate" to run

    Known Issues:
    ------------
    - ASF is partially supported
    - No Image Loading and Simulation Support for IFE except Linearization

    Tips & Tricks:
    ------------
    - Each run of Simulation creates a separate folder. This may take a lot of space on your hard disk. Go To "Edit->Clean Simulation Data" to delta simulation files.
    - For machines with limited memory, it may get slower after tuning some modules. You can delete images from image panel to improve performance.
    - If you face issue starting Chromatix, please install below :
        -- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64) - 14.0.24215
